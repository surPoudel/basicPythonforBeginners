# Introduction
I see a lot of biologists who are willing to learn python. However, it's really difficult to get started. I went through same stage and I am trying to support these biologists with very simple queries yet takes a lot of time because of lack of skills to even properly do stack or google. I will mainly focus on the LinkedIn users. I will also try to add functions for people who want to do something for their project based on suggestions. I also encourage others to contribute if they want to. We will also perform simple statistics based on need and interest. I will mainly use jupyter notebook for this purpose. 

# Jupyter Notebook
If you are new to using jupyter notebook. I suggest you go through basic tutorial. For example, I just googled jupyter notebook introduction and got the following website. I think this is a good introduction. You can also look at the youtube tutorials. https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/

# Conda Users
I suggest you make an independent environment and manage that environment installing needed packages for advanced user of python. We will need it in future so I suggest you go through https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html to understand how to install conda in your computer

# Python
I am using Python 3.7.10 on a Anaconda platform. conda comes along with Anaconda environment. Alternatively, you can install miniconda too. Details of Anaconda can be found here. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/
