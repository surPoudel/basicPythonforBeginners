# basicPythonforBeginners
I see a lot of biologists who are willing to learn python. However, it's really difficult to get started. I went through same stage and I am trying to support these biologists with very simple queries yet takes a lot of time because of lack of skills to even properly do stack or google. I will mainly focus on the LinkedIn users. I will also try to add functions for people who want to do something for their project based on suggestions. I also encourage others to contribute if they want to.
